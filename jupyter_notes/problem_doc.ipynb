    "**Process**: Talked about what challenges come from writing a generic csv writer. First challenge: How to generate all possible game states for the column names. The only way to really generate the column names would be to pull the game states from the raw game data after all of our games had finished. The issue is inherently solved when we use a game-specific csv writer as all game states are stored as a dictionary.  \n"

    "The main benefit to using a generic csv writer is that it will save time on getting the data to a format that we can easily put it into a data frame and create models for it.  However, if we are able to take the raw game data to a csv where the data will be mess but \"\"\"standardized\"\"\" using a generic csv writer. We can then take a csv from the generic writer and use a small formatting script to make the data readable to humans and also easy to put into data frames and models. This small formatting script would be unique to each game, but not as much work as creating a new csv writer for each game."
