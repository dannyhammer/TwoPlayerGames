    "*Toothpick Takeaway* is a simple two-player game involving a number of toothpicks on the table (in our case, 10) and two players alternating picking them up. Each player has the ability to pick up one or two toothpicks on his or her turn. Whoever picks up the last toothpick wins"

    "With the manually collected data we found that Player 1 did in fact have a better chance to win, especially with 10 cards.  While playing the game we realized that we know the winner when there are 3 pieces left on the table.  Since we know the outcome at 3 pieces, how can we manipulate the number of pieces so that our opponent always has to pick from a stack of 3?  We know that from when there are 6 pieces left in the stack.  If there are 6 left on the stack, then the player who has to draw will lose when plyaing against our strategy.  the next question is how do we get to 6 cards every time we play the game.  It is simple, if you are first, take 1 card(when 10 on table) this causes the amount of cards left to easily taken down to 6. We then posed the questoin of how far does this scale up with the amount of pieces available:\n",
