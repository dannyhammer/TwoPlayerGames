### Penland's Thoughts

- Remind us to be respectful of the fact that each member has unique talets and should measure our contributions based on what we say we will do not on how much that is
- We need to agree on main objectives on research, Penland wants the research to be enjoyable, not in the sense of slack off on work but enjoy our work.
- If we find ourseves not enjoying our research, we can resasses and talk w Penland
- Communicate more effectively
- Use professional tools like github in a more effective manner

  - Penland advises that we write parts of the paper when we can, such as the process of writing our code, then write our results when we are ready to
- Perform a literature review on paper with similar topics to see structure and gain a deeper understand from others viewpoints
- Keep in mind that where we wish to push our paper to (online journal, actual publication, etc) will influence the structure and the general style of the paper
