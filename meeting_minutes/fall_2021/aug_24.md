#Meeting notes for August 24 2021

## Reason: Discuss plan for paper

---

### What we want out of paper

- Danny
  - Would like to be published in a academic journal
  - would like to cover everything we have done so far from basic ideas and our background with the graph coloring game
  - outline what we did in terms of our code base
- Nick
  - End product should be publishable, OK with ACM or IEEE journal
  - Could also be standalone paper that could be passed off to someone that will be published into a jounral later
  - Should cover with background of the grpah coloring game and how we got to the point
  - how evo GT could influence design discovery and how more fields could use it
  - provide framework for longer winded workflows
- Andrew
  - Publishable anywhere, could even just be a website somewhere
  - Should cover process from Toothpick takeaway to grpah coloring and how to move from one game to another with as much code and process in silimar as possible
- Penland

  - Goal for final product that we are proud of and published somewhere, even if just an article
  - Not opposed to academic journal
  - Feel good about growth throughout the project
  - Gain experience with this style of writing
  - Gain experience guiding students through writing a paper (student oriented rather than instructor oriented)

- We should start writing something now, and figure journal out later
- Should cite Journals as targets and look at the style of papers within those journals
- Do reading while writing 60/40 or 70/30 favor reading
- https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3377930.3389830 an article to look into to make sense of what we are writing
- https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3446132.3446165 another one

### Where to start

- Start with an overview of what we want to write about
- First Iteration Excpectations
  - Two column paper should be 10+ pages, including images, code snippets, definitions
  - Spend a few pages writing about the question we are asking to give context to the rest of the paper
- Math papers are organized by intro, bg, prelim res, main res, conl.
- To adjust for CS we can reintroduce our problem statement inbetween bg and prelim
- the first sentence can be the purpose of this paper si to x y z, and we should change later to format in a way that is intelligent
- Should we use github for our paper?
  - pobably not, considering we can jsut use overleaf and all work at the same time and not worry about any screen sharing struggles
  - Also gets rid of us passing around a text file
  - bibtex for refrences
- Penland likes to write bg ideas when inspired and grind through definitions/refrences when not inspired/excited
- Danny - we shoud put in a "come back here" term to just find in the paper so we can find it easily and come back to work on it
- There needs to be a big idea for a paper
  - Needs to contribute something new to the field
  - using evo algos to search list structures wont surprise anyone in the field
  - Where we publish will also influence our tone, with being in an academic journal we need a new idea or something to contribute to the field
  - If we make posts on Medium, we can just say what we have done and make a short medium length paper based around knowing our audience is "less academic"
  - At beginning of year we can write to what we have for a medium post, then at year end write a formal paper to publish towards academic communities
- Analyze the strategies developed by our current code from the graph coloring game, and find similarities within the strategies
- look for graph automorphisms?
- worthwhile topic of investigation, graph autmorphisms, reinforced learning, similar to nodetovec
- we need to understand how graph automorphisms can have our strategies be very similar when we see them as different
- How do we include previous research?
  - What we publish is the tip of the iceberg, so we may not need to include the previous research into this paper, but it may not need to be mentioned for the paper to be deemed complete
  - If we host the game built 2 years ago and include a link to the game for the reader to try the game out and gain an understanding for the game
  - Talk amongst oursleves and figure out structure

### Where to go

- Find papers to look at and take inspirations from, i.e find a paper that is structured in a way we like
- Can be from any field, just should appear in a journal or is a very serious blog post
- We need an idea of what we want our first document to look like
- we need to aim before we shoot
- Pick a word we really want to use
  - Penland really like to find a way to use Juxtaposition in a paper
- danny wants outline
  - could be as simple as a bulleted list of what we want to include in the paper rovided little dupes
  - One person could start in the introduction and include what should go into the introduction
    - paper refrence
    - previous research
    - paper refrence
    - etc.
  - Once we have the stubs down we can go back and fill in
  - Essentially creating a wishlist
  - Where the paper starts (latex jupyter etc) doesnt matter we just need to start to write the thing

### Homework

- create a bulleted list of things we would like to include in the paper and bring to thursday meeting
- Figure out if there is a user limit on simultaneous collaboration for overleaf
