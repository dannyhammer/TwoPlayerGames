Project status: Implement working Unbalanced Rook(UR) by 2/12/2021

Issue: Toothpick takeaway strategy was always the same move set of {1,2} whereas in UR the piece is on an (x,y) coordinate. To develop strategies for UR in a similar way as previously, the input will be a position on the grid (x,y) and the output will be a direction (down or right) followed by number of spaces. For example: input(3,2), output(d,4) with (0,0) being in the top left corner.

Generating a population of players or evolution (a step by step process): 
   - 1) Generate a large player base with random strategies for each player
   - 2) Hold a tournament with the player base
   - 3) Track the winner of each game
   - 4) Keep player with a set win rate(~60%-80%?) or above and remove those below the threshold
   - 5) Generate new players as needed and hold tournaments until a noticed pattern occurs
    
Evolving:
   - A splice funciton that will take random pieces of the parent's strategy(coin flip) for each move and make the strategy that way. Include random mutation that will change one piece of a strategy output to increasy diversity in strategies.
   
   ex:(assumes all moves legal) 

|Player|In1|Out1|In2|Out2|
|------|------|------|-----|-----|
|Parent1  |0,0     |D,2     |0,1      |R,5  |
|Parent2  |0,0     |R,4     |0,1      |D,6  |
|Child    |0,0     |D,2     |0,1      |D,6  |

- The child will randomly take from its "parents" strategies to create a new strategy for each board state
    
Decisions:
   - 1) Should the losing players dropped from a tournament be kept around?(loser's bracket)
   - 2) Does an illegal move mean instant loss?
   - 3) What is the representation of a strategy? (make clear inputs/outputs)
