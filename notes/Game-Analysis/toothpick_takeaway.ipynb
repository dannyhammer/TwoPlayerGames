    "With the manually collected data we found that Player 1 did in fact have a better chance to win, especially with 10 cards.  While playing the game we realized that we know the winner when there are 3 pieces left on the table.  Since we know the outcome at 3 pieces, how can we manipulate the number of pieces so that our opponent always has to pick from a stack of 3?  We know that from when there are 6 pieces left in the stack.  If there are 6 left on the stack, then the player who has to draw will lose when plyaing against our strategy.  the next question is how do we get to 6 cards every time we play the game.  It is simple, if you are first, take 1 card(when 10 on table) this causes the amount of cards left to easily taken down to 6. We then posed the questoin of how far does this scale up with the amount of pieces available:\n",

    "Player 1's primary goal should be to force the game into a state where the number of toothpicks left on the table is a multiple of 3 _and_ it is Player 2's turn. We know this is a win condition for Player 1 by Theorem 1. Once this criteria is met, Player 1 will want to do the opposite of whatever Player 2 does. For instance, if the number of toothpicks on the is a multiple of 3 and Player 2 draws a single toothpick, Player 1 will want to draw two toothpicks, causing the number of toothpicks on the table to remain a multiple of 3 while on Player 2's turn. Essentially, Player 1 wants each game cycle (that is, both players take a turn) to decrease the number of toothpicks on the table by 3."
