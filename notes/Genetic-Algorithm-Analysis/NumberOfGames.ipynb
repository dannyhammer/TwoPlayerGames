    "\n",
    "We know that increasing the number of games each player must play will give each player a chance to compete against a wider subset of strategies.\n",

    "Game: We will run our tests using Competitive Graph Coloring and our 14-node graph from a previous Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "* Our fitness threshold will start at 0.5 and will not increase for the duration of our tests\n",
    "* The population size will remain at 100.\n",
    "* The number of iterations will remain at 10.\n",
    "* Mutation rate will remain at 0.025 for all tests.\n",
    "* Our control group will require at minimum 10 games to be played.\n",
    "* Our bounds will be fixed at 3. We know this graph has a known game chromatic color of 4, and that it is *possible* to win with 3 colors.\n",
