    "\n",
    "As we explore this area and try to find driving factors that assist in developing an optimal strategy for various two player games, we must first address some concerns and develop a plan of execution. This will ultimately help us know where the project and research have been, are currently, and are going to head towards. \n",

    "# 2. Recap Fall 2020\n",
    "During this semester, we all met and discussed the concepts the make up a game and what characteristics are to be observed to assess if there is a winner. This led to the creation of several python game classes that would be used to flesh out, what I will now call, a proof-of-concept for Toothpick Takeaway. By October/November, we were able to finally begin collecting data to start some very primitive analysis. One of the issues we faced was the formatting of the data in our final CSV as larger games did not format quite as nicely (this will be address later in this document).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Results\n",
    "\n",
    "A great thing that came from this endeavor was how we were able to abstract out the game glasses enough to let them act as interfaces for each *new* game. These files can be located along the path `/simple_games/generic_classes/`. Inside are the components that make up every game: \n",
    "- board - where the game is being played\n",
    "- player - represents a single player in a game\n",
    "- referee - monitors the moves of a player and validates attempted moves\n",
    "- game  - the object that has all of the mentioned components and begins the game\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great skill we developed over the semester was the ability to work as a team, communicating with each other via email and other means as necessary, to see the project progress. Our utilization of GitHub issues allowed for each member to choose something to work on. This helped keep a steady workflow and followed some of the principles of Agile development like Dr. Penland was hoping. "

    "## 3.1 Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to this semester. We have been able to further refine how the generic classes work and introduced some interfaces for our `ruleset` and `strategy` for each game. Interfaces allow us to require a certain functionality but the implementation is left to be decided for each game. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Under [Program Requirements](#Program-Requirements), we will address the interfaces and why they matter in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goals this semester include developing software that allows for new games to be added easily (which we are almost there) to gather data from in hopes of designing a genetic algorithm that can start to evolve against our hard coded strategies. Another goal, more in the immediate is to prepare a small presentation of all of the research up to this point for the MAA SE conference. \n",

    "## 3.2 Overcoming Issues\n",
    "One of the biggest issues that we are currently dealing with is identifying the system the this project relies on to function and how to design components such that we can each build something and then integrate back together. \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to address this concern at the next meeting so that everyone can feel a sense of project security. "
